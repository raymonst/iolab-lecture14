In this lab, you will learn how to create a simple interactive data visualization using D3.js in conjunction with other web technologies you have learned so far, such as HTML, CSS, & Javascript/jQuery.

You have a small dataset consisting of students and their grades. Your tasks are as follow: 
* Using D3.js, create a bar chart that shows each student & his/her grade accordingly.
* If the student's score is lower than 60, change the bar's color to red to indicate s/he failed the test.
* Create a hover event that shows the student's score when the cursor is inside the bar.

If you need more guidance, link the index file to "script-beginner.js"; otherwise, link it to "script-advanced.js"
